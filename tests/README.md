# UnDupeKeeper Tests
*Make sure UnDupyKeeper is correctly and safe working...*
--
    That is a test suite for making sure everything is ok.
## How it works:
That set of scripts are able to test UnDupyKeeper on a prompt shell.
## How to test:
1.) On UnDupeKeeper.ini file go to section [DEBUG] and set tag DEBUG_TEST = True  
2.) Set working directory on the script test[.bat|.sh] as basedir=<directory_for_dedupe_files>  
3.) Run UnDupyKeeper[.bat|.sh] with parameter --path=<directory_for_dedupe_files>  
4.) See the magic happening.
